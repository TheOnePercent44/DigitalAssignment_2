<h2>Kitten Carrier</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are running away from a dog catcher (for you are a dog) and you must not trip over logs and be caught or get mauled by bear traps.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel analog level control by using the mouse rather than the keys
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Shitty infinite side scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can do two things: move vertically on the screen and jump. Moving horizontally is automatic and constant. The player moves up and down by moving the mouse up and down, and jumps by left clicking. The goal is not to hit anything on screen (carefuly, objects are larger than they appear).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Analog mouse control over a digital space (pity the rest of the mechanics are too broken to properly evaluate it).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Errrrrr.... doubtful. It was a rough week. At least overlapping obstacles are easier to jump over. Score mechanic never implemented (was going to be distance based), and colliding with obstacles is easier than avoiding them. Also, infinite jumping, inspired by Sonic Boom (you can repeatedly jump forever)
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a dog. A stray. And you are running for your life. Forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored highschool kids (or college kids I guess, the only prerequisite is that they are seeking distraction from class).
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
0-30 seconds on average.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Flight.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Collision needs to be improved, level progression should be implemented, obstacle overlap needs to be corrected. Animation and speed variance both need work and all told the overall physics can be fine-tuned. That said, the game itself is simple, and to turn it into a fully fledged progressively more difficult infinite side scroller would take another 2-4 weeks at the pace I was going. Most of the present issues are my failure to master Phaser in a week, and the remainder are developmental stages for progression which would move very quickly once the core of the game is complete.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
wut?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Stolen everything from OpenArtWorld.com or whatever it was. Cool place, lots of stuff. Credit to the artists.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Got the idea from Phaser following mechanics. Ripped it apart, stuffed some stuff in. Struggled with art assets actually. General map things. It was awful. But yeah, it resembles every shitty side scroller in existence I feel. Not my best attempt over all. Rather diappointed.
